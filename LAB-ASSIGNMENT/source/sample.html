        <h1>Blockchain</h1>
        <p>
            BlockChain is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography.
            Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,a timestamp, and transaction data
            (generally represented as a merkle tree root hash).By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data.
            It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and
            permanent way".For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively
            adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block
            cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority.
            Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed
            computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.
            Decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.
